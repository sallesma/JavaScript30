    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let players2 = players;

    console.log(players, players2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players2[2] = 'Mario';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, players2);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const people = players.slice();

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const people2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const people3 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    people3[1] = 'Bob';
    console.log(people3, players);


    const people4 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        age: 80,
        name: 'Bob'
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 1;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    person2['height'] = 185;
    console.log(person, person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
